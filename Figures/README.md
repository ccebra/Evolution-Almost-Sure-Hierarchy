### Main figure files:
* BimatrixSBS.png is Figure 3 in the PNAS submission.
* RPF V1.png is Figure 4 in the PNAS submission.
* evolutiontest_run3.mp4 is the animated version of Figure 2 in the PNAS submission, updating by epoch.
* GP_proportional_1_10th_1600_trials.eps is Figure 1 in the PNAS submission.



### Scripts to generate figure files:
* The right three subpanels in Figure 3 are generated with combining_rhos_graphs.m script, applied to the data files located in the subfolder to this folder.
* All of the other graphs in Figure 3 and Figure 4 can be run using the appropriate PlotResults scripts, found in the Numerics folder.
* Figure 1 can be generated using the scripts in the "Random Matrices" subfolder to this folder.
* Figure 2 can be generated using the Evolution_Test_Switching_Analytic_Ratings.m script found in the Numerics folder.
